### Procedure

#### Solutions and Buffers Required: -

* Lysis Buffer-Tris, NaCl, EDTA, Glycerol (Maintained at pH-7.4)
* Saline Solution- NaCl
* SDS PAGE Sample Buffer-Contains Tris HCl, DTT, SDS, Glycerol, Bromophenol blue. It is usually diluted 2X
* Elution Buffer-IgG Elution Buffer or Glycine HCL.
* Protease inhibitors
* PBS Buffer

#### Preparation of Immune Complex: -

The protein sample is prepared, and X microliter of Lysis Buffer is added (Typically in 10:1 ratio)<br>
2-10 ug of purified antibody is added along with Cell Lysate in microcentrifuge tube<br>
The mixture is diluted with 300-600 microliter of Lysis Buffer<br>
It is incubated at 4 degrees for 1 hour to let the immune complex formed<br>

* Sepharose Beads are prepared. If it is a monoclonal antibody, protein G coupled Beads are preferably chosen, and if it is polyclonal antibody, protein A-coupled beads are used. Around 1ml PBS is added and then the mixture is centrifuged, the supernatant is removed and a buffer containing protease inhibitors (generally Lysis/Wash Buffer) is added to the precipitate and is ready to be used. Sometimes the beads can be washed twice before the buffer is added.<br>
* X microliter of Sepharose Beads Mixture is added to Cell Lysate. All the steps have to be done on ice till now.<br>
* The mixture of Lysate and Beads is kept in a Rotary Agitator for 4 hours in 4 degrees.<br>
* After the Incubation Time is over, the mixture is centrifuged, and the precipitate is washed with Lysis Buffer for three times.<br>
* Wash the mixture with 100 microliters of Saline Solution<br>
* Finally, X microliter of Loading Buffer is added, and the mixture is boiled at 100 degrees for 5 minutes to separate the beads and protein. Further, the centrifuged supernatant is stored.<br>
* Now the supernatant (containing isolated protein) can be eluted in two different elution buffers, depending on the use of the SDS sample elution buffer and the low pH elution buffer.<br>
    i) If we want to elute in SDS sample elution buffer we can do it in 50 microliters of SDS Sample Elution Buffer, centrifuge, and collect the supernatant.<br>
    ii) We can do in low pH elution buffer (50 microliters), centrifuge and collect the supernatant<br>
* The isolated proteins can undergo a western blot for further analysis.<br>

<i>*The Antibody Datasheet can be used to check the amount of Antibody concentration to be used.</i>
