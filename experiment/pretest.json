      "question": "1. Which of the following statements about immunoprecipitation (IP) is NOT true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "IP is a method that uses an antibody that binds to a particular protein to isolate and concentrate that protein from a sample.",
        "b": "Because Protein A or Protein G beads attach to the Fc region of antibodies, making it easier to capture the antibody-protein complex, they are frequently utilized in IP.",
        "c": "Because immunoprecipitation only enables the isolation of individual proteins, it cannot be used to investigate protein-protein interactions.",
        "d": "The washing procedure, which aids in removing other components and proteins that are not particularly bound from the beads, is one of the most important procedures in IP."
