### About the Experiment 

Immunoprecipitation (IP) is a widely used technique in molecular biology and biochemistry for isolating a specific antigen from a complex mixture using an antibody that specifically binds to that antigen. The process involves the formation of an antigen-antibody complex, which is then captured by a secondary agent such as protein A/G beads. This allows the targeted antigen to be separated from other cellular components, enabling further analysis like protein identification, quantification, or functional studies. Immunoprecipitation is crucial for studying protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications.
